# Twitter-Topic-Emotion-Analysis
Deep-Learning Framework for Spatio-Emotion Analysis of Geo-Tagged Tweets

Three useful elements from tweets - topic, emotion and location of the tweet; are inferred using a deep learning model and categorized based on the location in order to
give an overall visualization of the emotion in different places around the world for different topics.

An LDA model with gridsearch is used for Topic Analysis

An RNN + LSTM model is used for Emotion Classification
